  `Healthy, rich soil is crucial for the successful growth of fruits and vegetables. A soil test will provide information on the pH and health of your soil, and what you can do to optimise the conditions for successful growth.`,
  `Location is key! Your plants will not grow if they don't get enough sunlight. Make sure you plant them where they will receive at least six hours a day. You should also place taller plants on the north or west side so they do not shadow your smaller plants.`,
  `Spacing and arrangement of plants is essential! You want to avoid crowding them in one area, and try giving them around 8-10 inches of space in between, and avoid planting them in square patterns or rows, as that can stunt their growth. Try triangles instead.`,
  `There are plants that are compatible with one another, as they can help each other out in terms of growth and protection. It is useful to know which plants to grow around others, one beneficial combination would be tomato, basil, and onions!`,
  `You should sow your seeds! This is the best way to make them germinate. When sowing soil, it's best to complement it with seed sowing media, which can be a mix of vermiculite, peat, and perlite, as well as enough light and moisture.`,
  `It is essential to provide climbing plants with enough support so they grow strongly and vertically. You can do this using a trellis, a fence wall, or even just a stick!`,
  `Plot and rotate your plants every growing season! This will keep the soil in one part of your garden from being exhausted of its nutrients.`,
  `Dig regularly! This will allow proper growth of your plants. The best time to do this is between October and December, before the frost has set in.`,
  `Feed your plants! Different nutrients will provide support to a different part of the plant (where nitrogen assists leaf growth, phosphorus assists root development, and potassium is great for fruits and flowers). You can find fertilisers with different contents of each, as well as all-around ones with equal amounts of the three nutrients. (Be careful not to over fertilise as this can be harmful to your plants and soil).`,
  `Mulch can be useful. Adding a three-inch layer of any organic mulch around your plants will insulate the soil, keeping it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. It also helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. You should make sure to use good quality mulch that doesn't contain high levels of harmful chemicals.`,
  `Choose vegetables that are appropriate for your region! Don't buy those that require plenty of sunlight and warmth if you cannot provide that for them.`,
  `If you're new to gardening, don't overdo it! Start with a small garden, and easy to grow vegetables. It's easier to work your way up through the seasons rather than starting off too ambitious and losing interest.`,
  `This may seem obvious, but choose fruits and vegetables that you will want to eat. Your efforts will go to waste if you choose to grow crops that you have no interest in eating, and you may not even be inclined to take care of it whilst it's growing!`,
  `It may be worth keeping a journal of your garden. This will help you look back and see what you could improve on, or which plants are not suitable for your garden.`,
  `It's better to water deeply than more frequently as drenching your plants can lead to nutrient-deficient soil. The frequency of watering will depend on the plants and the location (and weather) of your garden, but you should try watering mainly the base of your plants.`,
  `You should consider raised beds and containers! Raised beds can help you achieve a deep layer of fertile soil for effective growth of plants, whereas containers can make it much easier for weed-control and preventing pests. It is worth noting that, with containers, you may have to fertilise and water more often.`,
  `Make sure to grow your plants in the right season. Failure to do so will result in lack of flavour or their inability to ripen on time.`,
  `It can be useful to grow comfrey among your plants as it has the ability to break down heavy soils and increase the bioavailability of nutrients for plants with shallow roots.`,
  `Want to avoid pests like birds and rabbits? Have some old clothes lying around? You should try typing up strips of fabric near your plants! In windy conditions, the unpredictable movement will scare away bunnies and most birds.`,
  `Making your garden more hospitable to pollinators will help you grow a larger variety of vegetables. Watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, eggplant, and hot peppers must have bees to pollinate them. Adding a dish with water and marbles for bees to land on and having a variety of blooms in your garden (during all seasons) will attract pollinators that help your garden flourish.`,
  `You can reuse water for your plants! Whether it's leaving out containers to gather rainwater, or using the water you used to wash your produce, or the leftover (cooled) water from boiling vegetables, these can all be used to water your garden.`,
  `You can use old corks to create the perfect holes to plant seeds in your garden! You can push them onto the prints of a pitchfork to then press into the ground.`,
  `Crushing eggshells into a powder and sprinkling or mixing into garden soil can be used to add calcium into the soil!`,
  `The optimal temperature for ripening tomatoes is between 20 - 25 degrees celsius. Once temperatures drop below 10 degrees celsius, green fruits wonâ€™t ripen!`,
  `Mound your potato plants deep under the soil and store harvested potatoes in complete darkness. Exposure to light can turn the skins of potatoes green, indicating that the potato has produced a bitter tasting toxin called solanine which if consumed in large quantities can cause illness.`,
  `You can reuse leaves that have fallen in the Autumn as part of your compost! Chop them up and use as compost ingredients.`,
